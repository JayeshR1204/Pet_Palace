        <center><h2>-:&nbsp; &nbsp;<u>  History  </u>&nbsp; &nbsp;:- </h2></center>
        <center><p style="font-size:1.2vw; text-align:justify; width:1300px;">The history of Burmese cats can be traced back to Burma (now Myanmar) in the 1930s. The breed was developed from a small number of cats obtained from Burma by Western travelers and brought to the United States and Britain. The exact origins and the specific cats used in the breeding program are not well-documented, but it is believed that they were descendants of temple cats in Burma.
            The breed's development began in the United States when a Burmese cat named Wong Mau was imported from Burma to San Francisco in 1930 by Dr. Joseph Thompson. Wong Mau, described as a small, dark brown cat, became the foundation cat for the breed in the United States. She was initially classified as a Siamese cat but was later recognized as a distinct breed.Dr. Thompson began a breeding program with Wong Mau, crossing her with Siamese cats to preserve her unique appearance and develop a breed standard. 
            This marked the establishment of the Burmese breed in the United States. The breed gained recognition and popularity for its striking appearance, warm temperament, and unique coat color.
