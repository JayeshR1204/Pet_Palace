        <center><h2>-:&nbsp; &nbsp;<u>  History  </u>&nbsp; &nbsp;:- </h2></center>
        <center><p style="font-size:1.2vw; text-align:justify; width:1300px;">The history of the Himalayan cat is closely tied to its parent breeds, the Persian cat and the Siamese cat. The breed was developed in the mid-20th century with the aim of combining the Persian's luxurious coat with the Siamese's striking color points and blue eyes. In the 1920s, breeders began experimenting with crossbreeding Persians and Siamese cats to create a breed with the Persian's coat and body type, but with the Siamese's color points. 
            In the 1930s, Virginia Cobb and Dr. Clyde Keeler, two American breeders, began a more systematic breeding program to develop the breed further. The name "Himalayan" was chosen because the breed's color points resembled the coloration of the Himalayan rabbit, which has a similar pattern.
