        <center><h2>-:&nbsp; &nbsp;<u>  Grooming  </u>&nbsp; &nbsp;:- </h2></center>
        <center><p style="font-size:1.2vw; text-align:justify; width:1300px;"> Japanese Bobtails are meticulous self-groomers. They have a dense and silky coat that requires regular attention. 
            They spend a significant amount of time licking themselves to keep their fur clean and tangle-free. This self-grooming helps to distribute natural oils throughout their coat, keeping it healthy and shiny.
            While Japanese Bobtails groom themselves, regular brushing helps remove loose hair, prevents matting, and reduces the amount of hair they may ingest during self-grooming. 
            Good oral hygiene is crucial for maintaining the overall health of your Japanese Bobtail. Brushing their teeth regularly using a cat-specific toothbrush and toothpaste is recommended.

        <center><p style="font-size:1.2vw; text-align:justify; width:1300px;"> Provide your Japanese Bobtail with a balanced and nutritious diet. High-quality commercial cat food formulated for their age, activity 
            level, and any specific dietary needs should be the primary component of their diet. Consult with a veterinarian to determine the appropriate feeding schedule and portion sizes for your cat.
            Fresh and clean water should be available to your Japanese Bobtail at all times. Ensure that their water bowl is regularly cleaned and refilled.

        <center><h2>-:&nbsp; &nbsp;<u>  History  </u>&nbsp; &nbsp;:- </h2></center>
        <center><p style="font-size:1.2vw; text-align:justify; width:1300px;">The Japanese Bobtail is believed to have originated in Japan over a thousand years ago. It is depicted in traditional Japanese art, including
             woodblock prints and ceramics, dating back to the 7th century. The Japanese Bobtail is closely associated with the iconic Japanese cat figurine called Maneki-neko or the "beckoning cat." Maneki-neko is often depicted as 
             a Japanese Bobtail with one paw raised in a beckoning gesture, believed to bring good fortune and luck to its owner.  The Japanese Bobtail has had significant cultural and religious importance in Japan. It was considered a symbol
              of good luck and prosperity and was believed to ward off evil spirits. The cat's distinctive bobbed tail, called "pom-pom" in Japanese, was highly regarded and considered a desirable trait.</p></center>
