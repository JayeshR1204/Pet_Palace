    <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>

        An Alaskan Malamute is one of the strongest and the largest of Alaskan or Arctic Dog Breeds. Hailing from a proud heritage of an intelligent and tireless canine, Alaskan Malamutes have won the hearts of many over the world with their strong disposition and endurance.   An Alaskan Malamute got its recognition in the world when George Lucas, while making Star Wars, portrayed the character of Chewbaca on his favourite pet Alaskan Malamute. Another famous character - Indiana Jones - is named after George Lucas’s pet Malamute - Indiana. The hollywood movie - Eight Below - too has  Alaskan Malamutes working alongside Siberian Huskies to make a heartwarming movie of the courage and determination of 8 dogs to survive. Alaskan Malamutes are often confused with another sled pulling dog breed, namely the Siberian Husky, due to their identical coats colours. However, that is the only thing common between a Siberian Husky and an Alaskan Malamute. An Alaskan Malamute is a much larger breed than a Siberian Husky and is capable of pulling large and heavy loads across the snow.Blessed with an independent, intelligent and strong personality, Alaskan Malamutes have been known to have survived the harshest of winters where temperatures have gone 70 degrees below zero, and have adapted themselves to their environment. This strong breed can fend for itself and hunt his own food without having any human supervision.   If you are a proud owner of this majestic breed or if you are planning to get an Alaskan Malamute as a family pet, you are making a wise decision. We bring to you all the aspects that you will have to keep in mind before getting a Malamute so that you are able to provide an environment that develops a healthy dog and a long lasting companionship.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>History</b><br><br>

        The Alaskan Malamute is the national dog of Alaska and its origins go back to the times of early explorers. While exploring the land of Alaska, explorers came across dogs that were unbelievably strong and were able to work in harsh climate often on little or no diet. Originally used to pull sleds or cargo over long distances and to hunt bears and seals, these dogs were very good companions of the Eskimo families that would adopt them as companions. When not hunting or pulling sleds, the Malamutes would play with the children and keep the family warm.During the Gold Rush of 1896, there was an influx of dogs to Alaska due to new settlers and many were bred with imported breeds. The Malamutes continued to be the strongest of the dogs and were used mainly for pulling the sled. The Mehlemuts, a local tribe of Alaska after whom the breed is named, lived in isolation from the new settlers and hence they were able to keep the Malamutes as pure breeds.

    <b>Unique Aspects</b><br><br>

    A Malamute has tremendous strength, endurance, intelligence and energy and despite their wolf like facial appearance, they are gentle and friendly.A Malamute has two layers of coats. The inner coat is wooly and oily and short that helps provide insulation against the harsh winter. The inner coat is also water and snow repellent; so in case they are caught in a snowstorm or rain, they can still stay warm. The outer coat is longer than the inner coat and coarse in nature. Malamutes shed their coat at least twice a year and your entire house can become a snow globe due to all the fur. Regular grooming and brushing of the coat is imperative for this breed.Since they pull weight and sleds, Malamutes have a very dense musco-skeletal structure especially at their chest and legs. A broad chest and strong legs are extremely useful during climbing mountainous regions or while pulling heavy load across the snow. One of the most unique aspects of an Alaskan Malamute is their bear - like paws. Also called “snow shoes” the paws of the Malamute have broad pads that act like snowshoes. The claws or nails are retractable, just like cats and help provide stronger grip in the snow. Unlike other dogs, Alaskan Malamutes rarely bark and their bark is more of a howl or a woo woo as compared to any other dog.

<p><b>Grooming</b><br><br>

    Alaskan Malamute is a big and furry dog that has a double coat, which is woolly in texture. The undercoat sheds all year round and more so twice a year when your entire house can turn into a giant snow globe. So if you do not want to see hair around you then this is not the right breed you. If you have or want to get a Malamute then getting that vacuum cleaner is not an option but a necessity.  <br><br>

    You will need to brush the coat at least two to three times a week and in shedding season almost every day to keep your house hair free.  These sled dogs will rarely need a bath and do not have that distinct doggy odor. They are more cat like in this aspect and keeps themselves clean.  <br><br>
    
    In addition to this you will need to follow a regular grooming regime with your pet that is brushing the teeth of your Alaskan Malamute, this should be done at least once on a  weekly basis as this will help to remove the tartar buildup and ensure a fresh breath at all times. This will also prevent various gum diseases. <br><br> 
    
    The toe nails will require clipping on regular basis to prevent any problems further as dog nails have veins in them and if it gets chipped then it can be very painful for your pet. You should always start this grooming regime in your pet from an early age as this will ensure that he is not temperamental when someone touches his or her feet, mouth or ear at a later stage

    <img class="info1" src="../../Pages/Boxer/Care4.png" alt="Information table4">
    <p><b>Common Health Issues</b><br><br>

Boxers are generally a healthy breed of dog. However, before getting a new puppy it will be advised that all medical history of the parents of the pup is referred to rule out any genetic or hereditary disorder that might inflict the pup.   Some of the common health issues that Boxers might be prone are:

<br><br>

<b>Cancer -</b> For reasons unknown, Boxers are more prone to developing cancer than any other breed. Excessive white marking on a Boxer makes it more prone to developing skin cancer and tumours. As a precautionary measure, apply sunscreen to your dog, especially on the ears, muzzle and paws to protect them from the harmful sunrays.<br><br>

<b>Hip Dysplasia -</b> Hip Dysplasia is a genetic disorder where the hip bone has a defect in connecting with the hip joint as a result of which the dog may experience pain or lameness in either of the rear legs. As the dog grows, he / she may also develop arthritis. Before getting a puppy, check the medical documents of the parents to rule out hip dysplasia.<br><br>

<b>Aortic Stenosis -</b> Aortic Stenosis is a cardiac defect that is found in most Boxers. Due to Aortic Stenosis, Boxers may feel lethargic all the time and have have episodes of fainting. When a dog has Aortic Stenosis, the heart works at twice the normal rate to pump blood. The defect in the aorta narrows the aortic valve to enable a smooth blood supply. When you get a boxer have a veterinary doctor check the heart for any murmur. Aortic Stenosis can prove lethal for the dog.<br><br>

<b>Hypothyroidism -</b> Hypothyroidism is another condition that inflicts Boxers. In hypothyroidism, the hormone gland of the dog does not function well and as a result, the growth and the development of the dog gets affected. Common symptoms of hypothyroidism include dull fur, extreme lethargy, obesity / weight loss and mental dullness. A full blood check up will be required to diagnose the problem.<br><br>

<b>Deafness -</b> According to research, Boxers, especially white Boxers are prone to deafness. Studies have shown that about 18% of white Boxers are born deaf either in one ear or both. In case your dog is deaf or has become deaf overtime, do not breed them.<br>  <br>

<b>Corneal Dystrophy -</b> Corneal Dystrophy is an inherited disease that inflicts most dogs, and is especially common in Boxers. In this disease, the cornea of the dog is either underdeveloped or is opaque. This might cause loss of vision to the dog. Gastric Dilatation Volvulus or Bloat - This is a common problem in deep chested dogs. Bloat can be lethal in nature if not detected early as it causes organ, especially gastric failure. In case of Bloat, there is a sudden buildup of gas in the digestive system and then causes the organ to twist.

    <h2 style="background-color: rgb(185, 174, 174);"> &nbsp;Alaskan Malamute Behavior</h2>
    <img class="info1" src="../../Pages/Boxer/Behavior-5.png" alt="Information table5">
    <p><b>Temperament</b><br><br>

        Boxers are one of the most playful and happy dogs. Extremely alert and watchful, German Boxers are also very poised, loyal, obedient, affectionate and self assured in nature. They have been blessed with a patient yet protective temperament making them very good family dogs.    Boxers require at least 1 - 2 hours of vigorous exercise that will engage them physically and mentally. Owners who will not be able to spend adequate amount of time with their Boxer should not consider this breed as a pet. The lack of exercise can lead to destructive behaviour such as chewing on furniture or digging in the yard.   Like all dog breeds, early socialisation with children, other human beings and pets will ensure a well developed and gentle temperament.
        
        <br><br>

<b>Environment</b>

Boxers do extremely well in both apartment and large houses. However, pet parents who live in an apartment will have to ensure that their dog is getting ample amount of exercise everyday to expend the excess energy and to stay healthy.    Due to their large size, Boxers may knock small pets or children and even things off while they are exploring around the house.    They are very sensitive to extreme heat and cold. So if you live in areas with extreme temperatures, extra precaution will have to be taken for regulating temperature so that your dog does not fall ill.

<br><br>

<b>Training & Intelligence</b><br><br>

Considered one of the intelligent breeds, Boxers do well with a strict training regime. First time owners of a Boxer may want to seek professional help from Canine behaviorists or Dog Trainers to ensure that a comprehensive training regime is designed for Boxers that keeps them engaged and also meets the characteristics of a working dog breed. Boxers respond extremely well to positive reinforcements and activities that allow it to think independently.For years Boxers have been trained for agility, obedience and other trainings that suit a working dog breed. As parents to a Boxer, be ready to spend a lot of time training and playing with your Boxer. All forms of training for your Boxer puppy should start at an early age. It will be imperative for new pet parents to start house training as soon as the puppy arrives so that there are fewer incidents inside the house.

    <img class="info1" src="../../Pages/Boxer/Breeding-6.png" alt="Information table6">
    <p><b>Procreation</b><br><br>

Boxers are a healthy and sturdy breed and become mature by the age of 3 years. If you are going to mate and breed your Boxer, make sure that you understand thoroughly the medical histories of his / her mating partner and also the medical history of the Boxer’s parents so make sure that they are not suffering from any serious genetic disorder that may be deterrent to the overall growth of the new puppies.   If you are a first time pet parent, seek medical advice to ensure that the mating and breeding process is comfortable for both the dogs.

<br><br>

<b>Puppies</b><br><br>

An average litter size of a Boxer varies between 2 - 10 puppies with an average life expectancy of 11- 14 years.    When the puppies are born, it will be imperative to vaccinate them and to train them from early own as they are extremely active and if not monitored may destroy furniture and other things that might catch their attention.

The length of the muzzle to that of the body should be in a ratio of 1:3. Boxers also have a well defined underbite i.e. their lower jaw protrudes beyond the upper jaw.   A full grown Boxer male will stand anywhere between 56 cms - 63 cms and weighs between 27 - 32 kgs while a fully grown female Boxer stands anywhere between 53 - 61 cms and weighs between 24 - 29 kgs.    Boxers come in three distinct colours - fawn, brindle and white with markings. In many Boxers, the chest will have a prominent white marking. Boxers have long and sturdy legs that come useful when they run and also, when they go on their hind legs and play or “box” with their forelegs.   In many countries, the ears and the tail of Boxers are docked and cropped. However, through the help of Animal Welfare Associations and Humane Societies, there has been a ban on docking and cropping of ears and tails of Boxers.
