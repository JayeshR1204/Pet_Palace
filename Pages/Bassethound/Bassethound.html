            A Basset Hound is one of the most adorable looking breed in the world. With an average lifespan of 10 - 12 years, Bassets have a long, short, large body.  Like other bloodhounds, Bassets have a loose droopy skin which give them a look of being sad and sleepy all the time, a look that adds to the charm of this breed. Bassets hold the world record for having the longest ears which help them pick a scent while they hunt. The neck of a Basset is wide and its skull has a dolichocephalic dark nose that has over 20 million scent receptors, compared to 5millions that a human nose has, making a Basset one of the best hunters in the Canine world.  A Basset Hound has a long barrel shaped body with a dense musco - skeletal structure. The fore legs are further away from the hind legs and are short with big paws. The big paws help the Basset to support its dense skeletal structure and overall weight. A Basset Hound may stand as tall as 14 inches but weigh between 20 - 35 kgs. The tail of a Basset is long and tapers especially when the Basset Hound is moving or hunting.
