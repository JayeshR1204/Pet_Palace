   <img class="info1" src="../../Pages/Beagle/1.png" alt="Information table 1">

    <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>

        One of the most adorable and popular breeds in the world, a Beagle is a member of the scent hound family. The name Beagle has been derived from the French word Beguele, meaning deep throat.

English Beagles are small, compact and extremely healthy a breed and make wonderful companions and family dogs.   One of the most famous Beagle has been Charles M Schulz.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>History</b><br><br>

        Though their history is a little lost, Beagles have been popular in the Middle Ages, Renaissance and even the early Roman Times.It has been noted that William the Conqueror brought Talbot Hounds to England during the Norman Conquest in the early 11th century.The first Beagles date back to the 1500s.<br><br>

The breed probably originated as a cross between the Harrier and other types of English hounds.<br><br>

Beagles gained popularity in England during the reigns of Edward II and Henry VII and later in the 1700s, they lost a bit of their popularity to Fox Hounds especially when it came to the popular sport of the time - Fox Hunting. In the 1800s American breeders imported Beagles from England and were used for hunting rabbits and hares.

The American Kennel Club began registering and recognising Beagles as a breed in 1884 as well as the National Beagle Club was formed and began functioning.
        
        <br>
        <br>
    <b>Unique Aspects</b><br><br>

    Beagles are one of the most beloved breeds in the world and it is often difficult to escape of the charming and upbeat temperament of a Beagleâ€™s beautiful eyes and expressions. Happy, outgoing, social and loving, Beagles make excellent family pets and make friends with the turn of their head.
    <br>
    <br>
Since they belong to the Hound family, Beagles are extremely inquisitive and are always on a search for an interesting trail to pursue.
<br>
        <br>
Compared to the 5 million scent receptors found in a human nose, a Beagles nose is blessed with over 220 million scent receptors. This is one of the reasons that Beagles make such wonderful hunters and sniffer dogs as they can recognise and remember the scents.

Beagles are known for their loud vocalisations and are probably the only breed that have three distinct vocalisations - a bark or a growl, a baying howl and a half baying howl. Beagles may bark regularly but when out hunting, the sight of a hunt can make start the baying howl.<br>
<br>

The half baying howl may be reserved when Beagles need attention or are simply bored or sad. Due to their loud howls, Beagles may not make one of the best apartment pets.

<img class="info1" src="../../Pages/Beagle/2.png" alt="Information table2">
<p><b>Grooming</b><br><br>

    Beagles make excellent family pets and are easy to maintain and groom. Beagles have a smooth, dense double water resistant coat that requires brushing to remove dirt and encourage blood circulation and hair growth.

    Even though Beagles shed, their short fur makes it go unnoticed.
    <br><br>

    Since Beagles tend to be extremely inquisitive about their surroundings and love to explore with their nose, they tend to get dirty real fast.Many a times, if they find an interesting smell, donâ€™t be surprised if they rub themselves to get the scent on them.
    
    Regular baths to keep them clean would be required, especially if they play or spend time in grass or a yard.<br><br>

    
    Beagles have long ears as a result of which the air does not circulate well inside their ears. As a pet parent you would have to check and clean their ears regularly to avoid wax buildup or ear infections.
    
    Brushing the teeth and trimming the nails will also make up an important part of the grooming regime for your Beagle. Also, while grooming, check for dry or flaky skin or sores or inflammation of skin, and if you notice any such symptoms, seek veterinary help to avoid potential health problems.
