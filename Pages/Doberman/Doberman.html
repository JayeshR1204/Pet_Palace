        Though the time lines are uncertain, it is said that Doberman were bred not less than 150 years ago in Germany around the year 1890 by Herr Karl F Louis Doberman. Louis was a tax collector and would have to travel to places that were dangerous as there were chances of being attacked by thieves or bandits.

        <br><br>

        He wanted a dog that was strong, athletic and fiercely loyal. He carried out experiments and bred Doberman Pinschers. Canine behaviorists speculate that a Doberman is a result of the experiments made with Rottweilers, German Pinschers, Manchester Terrier, Great Dane, Wiemaraner, German Shorthaired Pointer, Old German Shepherd Dog and the Greyhound.

        The breed was named after Herr Dobermann in order to honor his contribution to developing this breed. Post Dobermann’s death, German breeders continued to breed the “superior dog” which were known for their intelligence, bravery and strength.<br><br>

        Over a period of time, the dogs came to be known for being head strong and aggressive or ferocious in nature. It was in 1900 that the German Kennel Club recognised Doberman as a breed. During the World War 1 Dobermann gained importance especially with the police and military and also amongst very rich people who wanted to protect their houses from bandits.

<p><b>Grooming</b><br><br>

    Doberman are one of the most easiest breeds to groom. Blessed with sleek, short coat, Dobermann come in black, rust, blue, fawn or a combination of the colours with prominent rust markings.The coat of a Doberman Pinscher is short and does not shed much, so they require very little grooming.

However, pet parents to Doberman Pinchers will have to keep in mind that due to the short fur, the skin of the Doberman is extremely sensitive to extreme cold or heat. Therefore, if you are in a place where there are extreme weather conditions, please ensure that appropriate care is taken to maintain the temperature for the dog.

Dental grooming is also a must for the Dobermann. Regular brushing will ensure that there is no tartar or plaque buildup and the mouth of the Dobermann remains clean and there are no chances of the onset of any periodontal problems. To avoid any injury to the feet especially during running or playing, it will be advised that the nails of the dog are regularly trimmed and kept short.

Cleaning of ears using a ear wipes will also help avoid any ear infections or wax buildup. While grooming, check for any rashes or redness in the skin, especially between the paws and the ears.

A good grooming regime begins from an early age. Introducing your dog to dental, grooming  and bathing regimes will ensure that the puppy gets accustomed to the routine and is comfortable with it.

    <img class="info1" src="../../Pages/Doberman/5.png" alt="Information table5">
    <p><b>Temperament</b><br><br>

Pet parents to a Doberman Pinscher will have to understand that their Doberman does not like to be left alone for long hours and that he / she will require a schedule that keeps them engaged mentally and physically. Like Boxers, Doberman Pinschers take a little time to mature and gain full maturity by the age of 3 - 4 years.

Doberman Pinschers are one of the most versatile dogs in the canine world. Extremely loyal, intelligent, adaptable, skilled and blessed with a strong protective instinct, Doberman Pinschers make outstanding watch dogs and guard dogs. Their high intelligence makes them a preferred dog for the armed forces, police work and also for search and rescue teams.

Doberman Pinschers are not really the dogs for first time dog owners as they require a family or owner that displays a natural leadership and authority over the dog. Doberman Pinschers require firm yet gentle hand as they do not appreciate aggressive handling.

Like all dogs, Doberman Pinschers must be socialised with people, children and other pets in the house so that when they grow up the Doberman is gentle and does not show signs of aggressiveness.
        
        <br><br>

<b>Environment</b><br><br>

<b>Training & Intelligence</b><br><br>

It is due to their high intelligence levels and fierce loyalty that armed forces, police force, search & rescue teams and even guard teams prefer Doberman Pinschers over any other dog breed. When trained and socialised early on, Doberman Pinschers make wonderful family companions.

First time owners of a Doberman may want to seek professional help from Canine behaviorists or Dog Trainers to ensure that a comprehensive training regime is designed for Doberman that keeps them engaged and also meets the characteristics of a working dog breed. Doberman respond extremely well to positive reinforcements and activities that allow it to think independently.
