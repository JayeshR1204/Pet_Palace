    <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>
        It is very easy to confuse this breed for a Pomeranian. In fact there are many people who will still think that any white and small dog is a Pomeranian. This is a wrong notion though, not all white, small and furry dogs are Poms. Most of the dogs that you see around you are Spitzes. There are many varieties of Spitz as well but in this write up we will discuss the German Spitz.  

        German Spitzes are easy to train, a little persistence will ensure basic training. This is an alert and loyal dog that makes them easy to train.

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>History</b><br><br>

        The best way to know about the lineage of your pet is to start from the beginning. This breed has been present in Germany for a long time but it was not until the 1970s that this breed was introduced to the outside world. Scandinavia and Great Britain were the first countries to recognize this breed. After this the German Spitzes spread rapidly across the world soon.

        The German Spitz, it is believed, is the direct descendent of various Nordic herding dogs such as the Samoyed and the Lapphund. They came to Europe with the Vikings. In fact there is German literature that refers to Spitz somewhere around 1450 as well. It is hard to believe that the robust house pet was once as a farm worker.

        <br>
    <b>Unique Aspects</b><br><br>

    Your German Spitz has a dominating temperament though docile. They can quickly become the leader or the boss of the house. You will be surprised to see that this breed is small in size but because of its temperament can at times act as the leader of the larger breed in your home as well.

    The Spitz is one of the perfect breeds to be kept in an apartment; they are pretty active indoors and will prosper well even without a yard. This is an active breed and will love the regular outings and exercise so if you want company for your walks then this may just be the perfect breed for you.
    
    German Spitz is the perfect pet to be kept in an apartment but the one thing that has to be remembered at all times is that they can bark nonstop at times so it is integral to tell your puppy or dog to stop when required. They can bark obsessively, which can be a problem not only to you but can create nuisance for your neighbors as well. So, early training is very important for this breed. They are cheerful, bold and affectionate towards their master and will be easy to train.

<img class="info1" src="../../Pages/GermanSpitz/2.png" alt="Information table2">
<p><b>Grooming</b><br><br>

    The German Spitz comes in a variety of colors though the common colors include white, orange and black but do not be worried about maintaining it. When it comes to long-hair dogs this is rather a low maintenance breed. It has a silky texture, which does not trap mud or dirt easily. So, regular brushing on the coat will ensure that it remains tangle free and does not have any dirt trapped in it.

You will need to brush them at least three times a week to ensure that the coat is in its optimal health at all times but if he or she does not like to get dirty then this can be done once a week as well. These Spitzes shed heavily twice a year, though you will see hair lying everywhere in the house. So the best way is to brush the hair regularly so you can get rid of the dead fur from your pet’s coat. In addition to this you will need to follow the regular grooming regime with your pet, that is, brushing the teeth of your German Spitz. This should be done at least on a weekly basis as this will help to remove all tartar buildup and ensure fresh breath at all times.

This will also prevent various gum diseases in your pet. The toe nails will also require to be trimmed on a regular basis so as to prevent any problems further. Dog nails have veins in them and if it gets chipped then it can be very painful for your pet. You should always start this grooming regime in your pet from an early age as this will ensure that he is not temperamental with someone touching his feet, mouth or ear at a later stage.
