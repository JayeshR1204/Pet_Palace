        <br>
        <br>
        <b>History</b><br><br>

        This overly friendly dog originated some time around 1860 in Scotland by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks or fondly known as Baron Tweedmouth, an ardent hunter. As the name suggests, there were specially breed to retrieve ducks and fowls during hunting.

There have been two theories about the origins of this majestic breed. The first theory is how this breed has come from some breed of Russian Circus dogs brought by some English Gentleman. They were taken to some place in Scotland and they used to work on an estate.<br><br>
People were impressed by this breed and they were bred with some sandy colored blood hound and hence this medium sized breed was produced.Lord Tweedmouth is said to be the originator was this breed and the other theory is that he found a yellow Retriever and bred him with a tweed water spaniel which resulted in the creation of this beauty that is known by the name of Golden Retriever. The reason for Lord Tweedmouth’s breeding of this breed was to develop a breed which could adapt and thrive in the Scottish weather. Nous and Belle were the two dogs which gave birth to this breed. The name of the firstborn of Nous and Belle was Crocus. The earliest known jobs that this breed used to do was be a gamekeeper. He was also a Gentleman’s game keeper. Kennel club first admitted this breed in the year 1911 and was called Retriever – Golden or Yellow. This breed is also famous for being a great hunting partner. 
<br><br>

Baron Tweedmouth developed these majestic dogs by breeding the existing retrievers and water spaniels. After the hunter shot, it was expected that  they would run to retrieve the fowl or duck from water and grassland to their owner. They were given soft mouth as an essential characteristic for this work, so they don't damage the hunted game.  
        
        <br>
        <br>
    <b>Unique Aspects</b><br><br>

    Goldens are one of the best family pets to have, they are the lowest ranking barkers. So, no complaints from the neighbors about the noise level. They are one of the freshest smelling dogs as they do not suffer from bad breath, which is a common problem among dogs usually. They have been given an especially soft mouth that helps them to even hold a raw egg without breaking it, perfect to slightly hold the hunt in their mouth. 
    <br><br>

    A near perfect dog, Goldens make excellent indoor pets, be it with children or elderly; or a house with other animals. Their exemplary obedience level and intelligence have won them many laurels over the years.

They are also prone to hip dysplasia, a common joint problem with large active breeds that is mostly genetic but can be deteriorated with improper exercise.
        <br><br>

        If you are opting to buy a pedigreed Golden, then make sure you are well-versed with the health of the preceding retrievers in the bloodline. There are a few lineages that are prone to mast cell cancer, but this mostly sets in a dog after eight years of age. <br><br>

        
        The Golden Retriever basically lives for about 10-13 years. There are certain diseases and ailments that this breed is prone to. One of the most prone diseases that this breed can have is Cancer, nearly half of the Golden Retrievers end up suffering from cancer. It is generally towards their middle age, that they end up becoming prone to cancer. The cancer treatment ends up costing a lot of money and is also very painful for the breed. Another kind of problem that this breed is prove to are forms of skin allergies, half of this breed ends up suffering from some or the other kind of skin issues such as growths, cysts, tumors, skin infections etc. They are also prone to ear infections etc. Because this breed is active and loves running around, it is prone to wears and tears.

The most vulnerable age for this breed to suffer from cataracts is either when they are just babies or when they are middle aged, this disease can lead to partial or full blindness. Deep chested breeds generally suffer from conditions where they have bloating and which is generally a result of a gastrointestinal issue. Other conditions that the breed may suffer from are cold nose or snow nose where their muzzle turns cold because of the cold, it’s a non-threatening condition. There is a condition called subvalvular aortic stenosis which generally larger breeds are more susceptible to. Under this condition the blood vessel that carries the oxygenated blood from heart narrows down. Over a long period of time, the heart has difficulty pumping blood which can lead to death. This condition doesn’t get diagnosed easily as one of the most common symptoms is lethargy, the cause of which is difficult to figure out. One way to prevent this from happening is by regular checkups of heart. 
        <br><br>

    <img class="info1" src="../../Pages/GoldenRetriever/5.png" alt="Information table5">
    <p><b>Temperament</b><br><br>

        One of the most ideal breeds to share a home with, especially if you have children or are a first time owner. This dog will make best friends with anyone in seconds while making sure they are the centre of attention. With their antics and attachment to human beings they will never be further than an arm's length so it is always convenient for humans to pet them.
        <br><br>

        Very loving, highly playful and amazing with kids, the Golden Retriever is a high-energy dog. This means if you want a calm, well-behaved dog inside the house; you will need to supply them with ample daily exercise. They are not revered as good watchdogs because their guarding instinct is almost negligible. It is quite likely that an intruder will be welcomed by your Golden with a wagging tail excitable disposition.
        
        <br><br>

<b>Environment</b><br><br>

The Golden Retriever is a very high energy dog that will do okay in an apartment provided there is a medium sized yard in the vicinity to run around. Being rated as the lowest ranked barkers, this breed is ideal for a neighbourhood that does not take too well to dogs.

Like all retrievers they love games involving balls and  frisbees. Throwing around such toys is surely going to tire them out if you are an urban owner with little time to spend with them. Golden Retrievers are extremely active dogs so draining out their pent up energy is highly recommended with daily exercise of one hour minimum. They are excellent swimmers and really enjoy being in water, which is certain to tire them out for the day.<br><br>


The breed is relatively tolerant to both hot and cold weather. There are primarily two kinds of Golden Retrievers - American and British. The only notable difference between the two is that the American variety is leaner and a little larger than their British counterpart but both the varieties are suited to survive in almost all weather conditions. They are bred to adapt to almost any environment, giving them  conditional versatility.

<b>Training & Intelligence</b><br><br>

Golden retrievers are one of the most trainable dogs around because of their high intelligence and love for human attention and companionship. But getting very smart dogs for ease at home can also back-fire as they can end up outsmarting the humans in the house. With consistent training and guidance they have the potential to reach the highest capacity for a dog. That is why Golden Retrievers are preferred as service dogs around the world like mobility assistance, seeing-eye and many more.
<br><br>

Before getting ahead of ourselves, one need to come up with creative ways of training these dogs. In addition to easy  commands like 'sit', 'down', 'come' and 'stay' teaching them basic manners, both indoor and outdoor is advisable. Maintaining their calm state of mind is ideal for such over-zealous puppies. Always remember to praise desirable behaviour, even if it does not seem extraordinary to humans; appreciation goes a long way with dogs. They were the first ever obedience champions in the AKC show.

    <p><b>Procreation</b><br><br>
        Golden Retrievers are one of the easiest breed to handle. There is hardly any complication in its breeding. The only thing you have to think about is giving the adorable puppies up for sale or adoption to the right humans. An average male and female Golden attains sexual maturity anywhere between six to nine months of age. However, this does not imply that such a young puppy is ready to breed a healthy litter.
        <br><br>

        A dog takes around 18 months to reach his full height and structure. It is advisable to breed your dogs after at least two years of age. If you are first timer at breeding then taking a vets care is advisable. You just sit back and enjoy the company of six to nine adorable little puppies, an average litter size of the breed.
<br><br>

<b>Puppies</b><br><br>

Golden Retrievers are very active, as already established. So do not expect anything less from your puppy. They will have their bouts of random hyperactivity and then long hours of sleep. Many a times their behaviour becomes unpredictable. It is highly recommended for owners to start training their pup from day one, especially puppy toilet training.

<br><br>
Giving them a fixed set of rules around the house will help when they get older and stronger. Like any puppy, their teething phase will be stressful and they will not leave any object in the house without teeth marks, even humans. Hence, guiding them with the right toys and proper training will aid in managing most of these problem behaviours.
