        It is said that American Pit Bull Terrier has been around for over 500 years. There are a number of wide ranging theories about how this breed came into existence. This breed is also famously and often incorrectly known as the American Bully. Utmost importance has been placed on the aspect of selective breeding whenever the history of American Pit Bull Terrier is spoken about. One of the most popular theories of how this dog came into existence is how a strong pit bull was found by the breeders and it was bred with numerous terriers to come up with this American pit bull terrier. This breed was bred in English Isles and were brought to the states after a couple of breeds were produced. This was a sporty breed and used for purposes like bear baiting and bull baiting when it was still based out of United Kingdom. When immigrants started coming in to America, pit bulls were brought as family members. They were bred as fighter dogs because of their intelligence and loyalty. They received a lot of publicity because of their qualities. However fierce they are thought to be, a lot of testimony shows that this breed was very good with kids to live up to the expectation of nanny dogs that Pit bulls were. A Number of stories about famous pit bulls do the rounds these days. Somewhere around the 20th century, this breed was used by the Americans as a catch dog which could look after cattle.<br><br>


It is ironic that the Pit Bull is now banned in England though it owes its origin to the British Isles. They were brought to American by the English immigrants. The name says for them, the breed was bred to fight in a pit as a part of a sport. They were made to participate in sport called baiting a largely inhumane blood sport.In earlier days the dog was put in a pit with bulls and bears. This was banned around 1800s. The worse bit about this inhumane sport was that if the dog bit any of the handlers then they were culled on the spot as they were rendered unfit to be bred further. The Pitbull draws its dubious reputation from this.

    <h2 style="background-color: rgb(185, 174, 174);"> &nbsp;Pit Bull Behavior</h2>
    <img class="info1" src="../../Pages/PitBull/5.png" alt="Information table5">
    <p><b>Temperament</b><br><br>

        Pitbull was developed for fighting so be prepared to handle a temperamental dog right from the beginning. The behavioral traits of this breed demand this from him or her. The aggression is present in many lines of Pitbull even today and if you have cats and dogs in the house then this may not be the ideal breed for you as it may have a go at it anytime.<br><br>


        You also have to supervise your dogs at all times when taking him out to a park or a walk if he is getting aggressive then remove him immediately from that area as it can give rise to a ugly fight at times. If you have young kids at home then this may not be the ideal pet. They are recommended for mature handlers and certainly not for first time dog owners. Your kids will not be able to identify if your dog is getting aggressive and can accidently trigger temperamental issues with them.
        <br><br>

        Your Pitbull needs to be socialized early in life. If they are isolated for long times they can become aggressive towards any new comers. They need regular exercise so if you can devote time for regular runs or jog then this is the breed for you.
        
        
        
        <br><br>

<b>Environment</b><br><br>

<b>Training & Intelligence</b><br><br>

Pitbull is trainable, if you are getting a puppy it is advisable to check for the lineage of the parents before you get one home. If it shows parents with traits of being reared for a fight then your pup may not be the pet, which you want.

This is an intelligent breed but always remember that harsh training will never yield results for you. One has to be sensitive to the issue and maintain patience when providing training to your dog. The other thing is that your Pitbull will need training all through his or her life. Unlike other breeds the training does not end here, it will continue all through life.
