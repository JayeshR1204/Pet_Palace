    <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>

        This is one of the few Indian bred pedigree dogs that has been developed in the country and is almost on the verge of extinction now; there are just a few pockets at present in Tamil Nadu that have the presence of this breed.  In the recent times there have been a lot of efforts that are being made to encourage the breeding and popularize them in the country. 
        <br><br>
        In one such effort the Animal Husbandry Department of the Tamil Nadu government has sponsored the dog shows and has even set up breeding centers in the state in order to prevent the total extinction of this breed. In fact, this breed even adorned the postage stamps to create awareness for the dog breed.
        <br><br>
        The Rajapalayam was bred to be a vivacious hunter who had a huge appetite to please his or her master. They were developed to hunt for wild boar and other small prey. They make excellent guard dogs for the family. They are vary of strangers and their large size can intimidate almost any intruders coming into your home. You have to keep in mind that these are fearless sentinels will not like to be petted or even touched by strangers on the contrary they can charge towards strangers if they find them threatening.
        <br><br>
        The weather is not a problem with this pet as they were bred within the sub-continent and do not have much issues in this summer heat. They do not have many complications when it comes to their breeding and are generally a healthy breed. So they will not be many vet visits attached when it comes to this breed. <br><br>
        
        In this small write up we will help you to select the appropriate breed and if you already have this breed then we will try and help you to know your Rajapalayam better and even anticipate his next move or requirement.
        
        
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>History</b><br><br>

        Let us start from the beginning; the Rajapalayam has been bred in the Nayak dynasty of Tamil Nadu. There are some scholars who believe that they also have a presence in the modern day Dalmatian but there are no records for the same. Leaving this to speculation, these dogs were used in the Carnatic and Polygar wars.
        <br><br>
These dogs have been used since time immemorial to guard rice fields, houses and farms and have legendary stories around them as well. One of the stories say that four Rajapalayams together saved the life of their master by killing a tiger. Their fierce loyalty and guarding potential has seen them being deputed as guard dogs in the borders of Kashmir by the Indian Army.

        <br>
    <b>Unique Aspects</b><br><br>

    This first thing that you would notice in your Rajapalayam is their milky white coat that is almost a standard for the breed. This is one of those few breeds who do not come in a multiple colors but a standard white only coat.   This breed has a characteristic pink nose and skin, which is absolutely different when compared to other dogs around the world. This many say can be attributed to the albino effect in your dog

<img class="info1" src="../../Pages/Rajapalayam/2.png" alt="Information table2">
<p><b>Grooming</b><br><br>

    Rajapalayam have a short coat but do not be fooled by the length, they shed. You can brush them once or twice a week. They love being massaged so they will never complain if you brush them with a soft brush or a hound mitt.<br><br>

    In addition to this you will need to follow the regular grooming regime with your pet that is brushing the teeth of your Rajapalayam, this should be done at least once on a  weekly basis as this will help to remove all tartar buildup and ensure a fresh breath at all times. This will also prevent various gum diseases in your pet.
    <br><br>
   The toe nails will also require clipping on regular basis to prevent any problems further as dog nails have veins in them and if it gets chipped then it can be very painful for your pet. You should always start this grooming regime in your pet from an early age as this will ensure that he is not temperamental with someone touching his feet, mouth or ear at a later stage.

    <img class="info1" src="../../Pages/Rajapalayam/4.png" alt="Information table4">
    <p><b>Common Health Issues</b><br><br>
        Rajapalayams are generally a healthy breed but you have to remember when getting a puppy home that almost all and every breed has a chance of developing genetic disorders and they can also catch any of the common diseases. So this not a word of law these are some of the unfortunate cases that you can encounter with your Rajapalayams at times.<br><br>

        The most common problem that is associated with many white coat dogs is of deafness. It is very important to know that the coat and the eye color is decided by a pigment producing cells called melanocytes, if these are absent in the genes. The hearing cells also originate from the same stem cells as pigment-producing cells. Therefore if an animal has no pigment in its body, it generally leads to deafness.<br><br>
        
        In addition to these there are a lot of skin problems that are associated with this all white breed. One of the most common  diseases are mange and dermatitis. It can be because of the area in which these dogs are bred. The hot and moist areas are the perfect breeding grounds for various bacteria and insects.
