        One of the most common problems in your Rampur Hound is of bloating. This is caused with the sudden influx of gas and air in the stomach. Though this is not fatal but should be treated early to avoid any complication later. This can also happen because of the twist in the stomach for this a surgery is required. This can also happen in cases where the dog is fed once a day. It is recommended that if your dog suffers from bloating then the meals should be broken into two to three meals a day rather the dog is fed once a day.   
        <br><br>
        The other common problem with Rampur hounds is that they can easily develop skin sores; their athletic frame does not do well on hard floor. So it is very important to remember to provide soft bedding to your pet. In addition to this as most sight hounds the Rampur Hounds in general are sensitive to anesthesia. This can be specially related to the breeds low body fat percentage. This can becomes a problem when the pet needs to go through some surgery.
