        <center><h2><u>About This Pet</u> </h2></center>
        <center><p style="font-size:1.2vw; text-align:justify; width:1300px;">The Ragdoll cat is a popular breed known for its striking blue eyes, silky fur, and docile nature. Ragdolls are large, muscular cats with semi-long hair. They have a broad head, a strong chin, and distinctive blue eyes. Their fur is soft and plush, and it comes in various colors and patterns, including seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, and more.
             The Ragdoll breed was developed in the 1960s by a breeder named Ann Baker in Riverside, California, USA. The breed's foundation cat was a white domestic longhair named Josephine, who produced kittens with unique traits such as their relaxed temperament and tendency to go limp when picked up, hence the name "Ragdoll". Ragdolls are slow to develop both physically and emotionally. They reach their full size and coat length around three to four years of age. Their color patterns and eye color may also continue to develop and deepen during this time.
