If you do need to bathe your Siberian cat, use a cat-specific shampoo and lukewarm water.

Establish a routine of regular teeth brushing using a cat-specific toothbrush and toothpaste. This helps prevent dental issues, such as tartar buildup and gum disease. Additionally, providing dental treats or toys designed to promote oral health can contribute to maintaining good dental hygiene.
