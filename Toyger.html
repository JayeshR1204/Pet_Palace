        <center><h2>-:&nbsp; &nbsp;<u>  History  </u>&nbsp; &nbsp;:- </h2></center>
        <center><p style="font-size:1.2vw; text-align:justify; width:1300px;"> The Toyger cat breed was developed in the 1980s by Judy Sugden, a breeder in the United States.To create the Toyger breed, Sugden used domestic Bengal cats with distinctive coat patterns and physical traits, such as rosettes and a muscular body structure. Sugden focused on producing Toygers with well-defined vertical stripes, circular markings on the head, and a rich, vibrant coat color reminiscent of a tiger. 
            The breeding program involved careful selection of parent cats that displayed desired traits, such as clear and bold markings, good body conformation, and a friendly temperament. In 2000, the Toyger breed gained recognition by The International Cat Association (TICA) as an experimental breed. This allowed Toygers to be shown in TICA cat shows, and their pedigrees could be recorded.Toygers continue to be bred by dedicated breeders who aim to maintain and improve the breed's distinctive appearance and friendly personality.</p></center>
