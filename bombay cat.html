        <center><h2>-:&nbsp; &nbsp;<u>  History  </u>&nbsp; &nbsp;:- </h2></center>
        <center><p style="font-size:1.2vw; text-align:justify; width:1300px;">The American Curl is a relatively new and distinct breed of cat that originated in Lakewood, California, in the early 1980s. The breed's unique characteristic is its curled ears, which give it a distinctive and appealing appearance.
            The curled ears of Shulamith were not a result of selective breeding but rather a natural genetic mutation. This trait is caused by a dominant gene that affects the cartilage of the ear, causing it to curl backward.
            Recognizing the unique and desirable trait of Shulamith's curled ears, the Rugas decided to establish a breeding program to develop a new breed based on this characteristic.
            the American Curl gained popularity and attracted the interest of cat enthusiasts worldwide. Breeders in different countries contributed to the breed's development, helping establish a diverse and robust population.</p></center>
